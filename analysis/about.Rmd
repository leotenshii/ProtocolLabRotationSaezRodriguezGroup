This is the protocol for my lab rotation with the Saez-Rodriguez Group during my master's studies at Heidelberg University from 12.23 to 3.24. 
During the rotation, I created different vignettes for the R-package [MISTy]("https://saezlab.github.io/mistyR/index.html") under the supervision of Jovan Tanevski.
On this website, I wrap up the project with some additional information about my work.
