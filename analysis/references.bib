  abstract = {Advances in transcriptomic technologies have deepened our understanding of the cellular gene expression programs of multicellular organisms and provided a theoretical basis for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches lose the spatial context of cells within the tissue microenvironment, and the development of spatial transcriptomics has made overall bias-free access to both transcriptional information and spatial information possible. Here, we elaborate development of spatial transcriptomic technologies to help researchers select the best-suited technology for their goals and integrate the vast amounts of data to facilitate data accessibility and availability. Then, we marshal various computational approaches to analyze spatial transcriptomic data for various purposes and describe the spatial multimodal omics and its potential for application in tumor tissue. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion and outlook of the spatial transcriptomic technologies, data resources and analysis approaches to guide current and future research on spatial transcriptomics.}

abstract = {The diverse cell types of an organ have a highly structured organization to enable their efficient and correct function. To fully appreciate gene functions in a given cell type, one needs to understand how much, when and where the gene is expressed. Classic bulk RNA sequencing and popular single cell sequencing destroy cell structural organization and fail to provide spatial information. However, the spatial location of gene expression or of the cell in a complex tissue provides key clues to comprehend how the neighboring genes or cells cross talk, transduce signals and work together as a team to complete the job. The functional requirement for the spatial content has been a driving force for rapid development of the spatial transcriptomics technologies in the past few years. Here, we present an overview of current spatial technologies with a special focus on the commercially available or currently being commercialized technologies, highlight their applications by category and discuss experimental considerations for a first spatial experiment.}

abstract = {Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide(1). Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality(2). Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.}
